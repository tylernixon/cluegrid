### Phase 4: Post-Launch Growth (Weeks 6-12)

| Week | Focus |

## 2. Channel Strategy

### 2.1 Primary Launch Channels (Day 1)

| Channel | Approach | Expected Impact |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Product Hunt** | Full launch with maker story, GIFs, community engagement | 500-2,000 visitors on launch day |
| **Hacker News** | "Show HN" post emphasizing clean tech stack and design philosophy | 200-1,000 visitors if it lands |
| **Reddit (r/wordle)** | Genuine post: "I built a word game that combines Wordle and crosswords" | 100-500 visitors |
| **Reddit (r/crossword)** | Frame as "crossword clues meet Wordle deduction" | 50-200 visitors |
| **Word Game Discord servers** | Share in 3-5 active servers with permission from mods | 100-300 visitors |

### 2.2 Secondary Channels (Week 1-2)

| Channel | Approach | Expected Impact |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **X/Twitter** | Daily puzzle tease, share card examples, engage word game community | Slow burn, compounds |
| **Indie game bloggers** | Personalized outreach to 15-20 bloggers covering casual/word games | 2-5 features |
| **Reddit (r/puzzles, r/IndieGaming)** | Cross-posts tailored to each community | 50-100 visitors each |
| **Threads / Bluesky** | Mirror X content, catch early adopter audiences | Bonus reach |

### 2.3 Ongoing Growth Channels

| Channel | Cadence | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Daily email** | Daily at 8am local | Retention: remind players the new puzzle is live |
| **Share cards** | Every completion | Organic viral loop: players share results on social |
| **Discord community** | Always-on | Retention: discussion, feedback, sense of belonging |
| **Weekly recap email** | Weekly (Sundays) | Re-engage lapsed players with week-in-review stats |

### 2.4 Channels to Avoid (For Now)

| Channel | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Paid ads (Meta, Google) | Too expensive for an unproven product; organic signal first |
| TikTok | Requires video production capacity we do not have yet |
| App Store (native) | Web-first; native only if retention validates |
| Podcast sponsorships | Expensive, hard to measure, premature |

## 3. Beta Recruitment Plan

### 3.1 Recruitment Targets

| Phase | Target Size | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Internal (Days 1-5) | 20-50 | Team, friends, family |
| Early beta (Days 5-10) | 100-200 | Waitlist signups, personal network |
| Expanded beta (Days 10-14) | 200-500 | Reddit, Discord, word game communities |

### 3.2 Beta Tester Profile

The ideal beta tester is someone who:
- Plays Wordle or a daily word game at least 3x/week
- Is willing to give honest feedback (not just friends being nice)
- Can articulate what feels off vs. what feels good
- Represents our target personas (Morning Ritualist, Word Nerd, Casual Gamer)

### 3.3 Recruitment Tactics

**Waitlist Landing Page (cluegrid.app)**
- Headline: "A smarter daily word puzzle. Launching soon."
- Value prop: "Wordle meets crossword clues. 3-5 minutes. No ads. Free."
- Email capture + "How many word games do you play per week?" (single question for segmentation)
- Share incentive: "Move up the waitlist by sharing with friends" (optional viral mechanic)

**Reddit Recruitment Posts**

For r/wordle:
> "Hey r/wordle -- I'm building a daily word game called Cluegrid that adds crossword-style clues to the Wordle formula. Looking for 200 beta testers who want to try it before launch and help shape the difficulty. Free, no ads, takes 3-5 minutes. Anyone interested?"

For r/crossword:
> "Daily puzzle lovers -- would you play a 3-minute game that combines crossword clues with Wordle-style deduction? Looking for beta testers for Cluegrid. It is free and ad-free. Link in comments."

**Discord Outreach**
- Join 3-5 active word game Discord servers
- Participate genuinely for a few days before mentioning Cluegrid
- Ask mods permission before posting recruitment messages
- Offer a "Beta Tester" role in our own Discord

### 3.4 Beta Feedback Mechanisms

| Method | When | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| In-app feedback button | Always visible during beta | Capture in-context frustration or delight |
| Daily Discord thread | After each puzzle | Qualitative discussion: "Was today's puzzle fair?" |
| Weekly survey (3 questions) | Every Friday | Track NPS, difficulty perception, feature requests |
| Analytics dashboard | Continuous | Quantitative: completion rate, guess distribution, retention |

### 3.5 Beta Communication Cadence

| Day | Communication |
|-----|---------------|
| Day 0 | Welcome email + Discord invite + "How to Play" link |
| Day 3 | Check-in email: "How are the first few puzzles?" + feedback form |
| Day 7 | Week 1 recap: community stats, top feedback themes, what we fixed |
| Day 14 | Beta wrap-up: thank you, what's next, "You're founding members" |

## 4. Product Hunt Strategy

### 4.1 Timing

- **Launch day:** Wednesday (highest traffic day on Product Hunt)
- **Post time:** 12:01 AM PT (get full 24 hours of voting)
- **Avoid:** Major product launches from FAANG, holidays, long weekends

### 4.2 Listing Draft

**Tagline:** "Wordle meets crossword clues -- a smarter daily word puzzle"

**Description:**
> Cluegrid is a free, ad-free daily word puzzle where you guess a hidden 5-letter word using crossword-style clues for intersecting words. Each clue gives you a new angle of attack. Solve the crossers, reveal key letters, and crack the main word -- all in under 5 minutes.
>
> We built Cluegrid for people who love Wordle's simplicity but want a bit more depth without the time commitment of a full crossword.
>
> Features:
> - Daily puzzle with new clues every day
> - Wordle-style feedback (green, yellow, gray)
> - Crossword clues that reveal letters when you solve them
> - Streak tracking and stats
> - Shareable results (no spoilers)
> - Dark mode, mobile-first, accessible
> - Free. No ads. No paywall.

**Maker Comment (first comment on the post):**
> Hi Product Hunt! I'm [Name], and I built Cluegrid because I wanted a daily word puzzle that felt smarter than Wordle but quicker than a crossword.
>
> The core idea: you get a hidden 5-letter word, but instead of guessing blind, you get crossword-style clues for words that intersect with it. Each solved crosser reveals a letter of the main word. It adds a layer of deduction that makes solves feel more satisfying.
>
> I'd love feedback on:
> - Is the difficulty right? (targeting 70-80% win rate)
> - Does the clue system feel fair?
> - Would you come back tomorrow?
>
> Try today's puzzle at cluegrid.app -- takes about 3 minutes.

## 5. Community Seeding Approach

### 5.1 Philosophy

We build community by being genuine members of word game communities first. We contribute value -- discussion, tips, appreciation for others' work -- before we ever mention our own product. Growth follows trust.

### 5.2 Target Communities

| Community | Size | Approach | Priority |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| r/wordle | ~300K members | Active participation, then share when appropriate | High |
| r/crossword | ~100K members | Participate in puzzle discussions | High |
| r/puzzles | ~2M members | Share as unique content, not promo | Medium |
| Word game Discord servers (3-5) | Varies | Join, contribute, build relationships | High |
| NYT Games X/Twitter community | Large, engaged | Engage with daily puzzle conversation | Medium |
| Indie gaming subreddits | Varies | Cross-post at launch | Low |
| Casual game blogs / newsletters | Varies | Pitch for coverage | Medium |

### 5.3 Community Engagement Calendar (Pre-Launch)

| Week | Actions |
|------|---------|
| W-4 | Create accounts, start following/subscribing to key communities |
| W-3 | Begin participating: comment on Wordle discussions, share puzzle tips, respond to posts |
| W-2 | Increase engagement: post original observations about word games, difficulty, design |
| W-1 | Soft tease: "Working on something for word game lovers -- more soon" |
| Launch | Full post with genuine story, link, and invitation for feedback |

### 5.4 Content Themes for Community

1. **Behind the build** -- Share design decisions, tradeoffs, what makes Cluegrid different
2. **Puzzle design** -- How we write clues, balance difficulty, avoid unfairness
3. **Word nerd culture** -- Observations about word games, language, daily rituals
4. **Community stats** -- Aggregate completion rates, hardest puzzle of the week, streaks
5. **Player spotlights** -- Celebrate long streaks, clever strategies, community contributions

### 5.5 Discord Community Structure

**Channels:**
- `#daily-puzzle` -- Spoiler-tagged discussion of today's puzzle
- `#general` -- Word game chat, off-topic
- `#feedback` -- Bug reports, suggestions, feature requests
- `#announcements` -- Updates from the team (low frequency)
- `#streaks` -- Brag about your streak, encourage others

**Roles:**
- `@Beta Tester` -- Founding members from beta
- `@Puzzle Master` -- 30+ day streak holders
- `@Contributor` -- People who submit quality feedback

---

## 6. Growth Mechanics

### 6.1 Share Card (Primary Viral Loop)

The share card is the single most important growth mechanic. Every completion is a potential impression.

```
CLUEGRID #47
4/6 guesses | 3/3 crossers

🟨 _ _ _ _
🟩🟩 _ _ _
🟩🟩🟩 _ _
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩

cluegrid.app
```

**Design Principles:**
- No spoilers (letters never shown)
- Compact enough for a tweet/text
- Includes puzzle number (creates FOMO: "I'm on #47, where are you?")
- Shows crosser count (differentiator from Wordle)
- URL always present (converts impressions to visits)

**Share Flow:**
1. Player completes puzzle (win or loss)
2. Completion screen shows `[Share Result]` button prominently
3. Tap generates formatted text
4. On mobile: native share sheet (iMessage, WhatsApp, X, etc.)
5. On desktop: copies to clipboard with toast confirmation

### 6.2 Streak Mechanics (Retention Loop)

| Streak Length | Reward |
|---------------|--------|
| 3 days | Fire emoji appears on share card |
| 7 days | "Week warrior" label in stats |
| 14 days | Share card gets a subtle visual upgrade |
| 30 days | "Puzzle Master" achievement |
| 100 days | "Century club" badge |

**Soft Streak (Grace Day):**
- Miss one day? Your streak freezes but does not reset
- Miss two consecutive days? Streak resets
- This reduces anxiety and keeps players from quitting after one miss

### 6.3 Daily Email Reminder (Retention Loop)

**Subject lines (rotate):**
- "Puzzle #48 is live. Can you keep your streak?"
- "Today's Cluegrid is waiting for you."
- "Your streak is at 12 days. Don't stop now."
- "New clues, new word. Ready?"

**Email body:** Minimal. Puzzle number, one-line tease (no spoilers), CTA button. Unsubscribe link. Nothing else.

**Timing:** 8:00 AM in user's local timezone (inferred from browser data, defaulting to UTC-5).

### 6.4 Future Growth Mechanics (Post-MVP)

| Mechanic | Description | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Leaderboards | Weekly/monthly rankings by streak, win rate | Competition drives engagement |
| Multiplayer | Head-to-head or co-op puzzle solving | Social stickiness |
| Weekly recap | "Your week in Cluegrid" email with personal stats | Re-engagement |
| Referral program | "Invite 3 friends, unlock a cosmetic theme" | Direct acquisition |
| Embed widget | Let bloggers embed today's puzzle | Distribution |

### 8.4 North Star Metric

**Weekly Active Solvers (WAS):** Number of unique users who complete at least one puzzle per week.

This metric captures both acquisition and retention in a single number. If WAS grows, we are winning. If it plateaus or declines, we investigate which side of the funnel is leaking.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Product Hunt launch flops | Medium | Medium | Have backup channels ready; PH is one channel, not the whole strategy |
| Reddit posts get removed for self-promotion | Medium | Low | Establish credibility first; follow subreddit rules; use genuine tone |
| Low share rate kills viral loop | Medium | High | A/B test share card formats; add share prompts at high-emotion moments |
| Beta testers churn before launch | Medium | Medium | Keep beta short (2 weeks); communicate progress; make testers feel invested |
| Press ignores outreach | High | Low | Press is a bonus, not the plan; organic community is the foundation |
| Difficulty complaints dominate feedback | Medium | Medium | Fast iteration on difficulty; transparent communication about tuning |
| Someone builds a clone | Low | Low | Speed and community are the moat; execute well, not perfectly |
