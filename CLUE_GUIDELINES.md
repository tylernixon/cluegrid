# Cluegrid - Clue Quality Guidelines

## 1. The Clue Philosophy

A great Cluegrid clue creates an "aha" moment. The solver should feel clever when they get it -- not frustrated, not bored. We aim for that sweet spot where the clue is tricky enough to require thought but fair enough that the answer feels inevitable once you see it.

Remember: players have **no direct clue** for the main word. Crossers are their lifeline. If our crosser clues are bad, the entire puzzle falls apart. Every clue we write either builds trust or destroys it.

## 2. Core Rules

### 2.1 The Five Commandments

1. **One clear answer.** If a clue could reasonably point to two different words of the same length, rewrite it.
2. **No specialized knowledge.** A 16-year-old and a 60-year-old in any English-speaking country should both have a fair shot.
3. **No answer leakage.** The clue must never contain the answer word or an obvious root/variant of it.
4. **Grammatically correct.** Clues are complete thoughts. They end with punctuation.
5. **Honest misdirection only.** It is fine to lead solvers down the wrong path, but the correct answer must always be defensible.

### 2.2 Length Requirements

- **Minimum:** 10 characters (~2-3 words). Anything shorter is probably just a synonym/definition.
- **Maximum:** 200 characters (~30-40 words). Anything longer is a paragraph, not a clue.
- **Sweet spot:** 30-100 characters. Enough to paint a picture, short enough to scan quickly.

### 2.3 The Answer-Containment Rule

The clue must NOT contain:
- The answer word itself (e.g., clue for PLANT must not include "plant")
- The answer's root (e.g., clue for RUNNER must not include "run")
- A direct anagram that makes the answer obvious
- A phonetic spelling of the answer

## 3. Clue Types (Best to Worst)

### Tier 1: Evocative / Descriptive (Preferred)

Paint a picture or describe a scenario. These make the solver think laterally.

| Word | Clue | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| STEAM | What rises from a fresh cup of coffee on a cold morning. | Sensory, visual, universally relatable. |
| CRANE | Long-necked wading bird often seen standing on one leg. | Specific enough to rule out "heron" by the intersection letters. |
| BLAZE | What a campfire becomes when the wind picks up. | Evocative, leads the solver to fire-related words. |
| FROST | The white coating on grass when you step outside on a winter morning. | Sensory and seasonal -- everyone has seen this. |

### Tier 2: Functional / Contextual (Good)

Describe what the thing does or where you find it.

| Word | Clue | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| LEVER | Pull this to make a machine do something. | Clear function, common knowledge. |
| SHELF | Where books wait to be picked up. | Slightly poetic, but unambiguous. |
| GRAIN | The tiny unit that makes up a bag of rice. | Specific enough context. |

### Tier 3: Definition-Plus (Acceptable)

A dictionary definition with added context to narrow it down.

| Word | Clue | Why it works |
|------|------|--------------|
| BRAVE | Willing to face danger, like a firefighter entering a burning building. | Definition + example keeps it from being too dry. |
| CHORD | Three or more musical notes played at the same time. | Technical but widely known. |

### Tier 4: Bare Definitions (Avoid)

| Word | Clue | Why it is bad |
|------|------|---------------|
| BRAVE | Courageous. | Too easy. No satisfaction in solving. |
| PLANT | A living organism. | Could be an animal, fungus, etc. Too vague AND too easy. |

### Tier 5: Trivia / Obscure References (Never)

| Word | Clue | Why it is bad |
|------|------|---------------|
| CRANE | Frasier actor's last name. | US pop culture. Not everyone watches American sitcoms. |
| DERBY | English city where Rolls-Royce was founded. | Specialized knowledge. Unfair. |
| ADOBE | Company that makes Photoshop. | Brand knowledge. Not universal. |

## 4. Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### 4.1 Ambiguous Clues

**Bad:** "A type of fish." (BASS, CARP, TROUT, PIKE, SOLE...)
**Fixed:** "Flatfish often served with lemon and chips." (SOLE)

**Bad:** "Something you throw." (BALL, DISC, DART, DICE...)
**Fixed:** "Round object kicked across a pitch." (BALL)

### 4.2 US-Centric Clues

**Bad:** "Where you put the trash on Tuesday nights." (Assumes US curbside pickup norms)
**Fixed:** "A large container for household waste." (BIN)

**Bad:** "What you need to drive on the interstate." (Interstate is US-specific)
**Fixed:** "What you need before you can legally drive a car." (LICENSE -- but note spelling varies by region, so avoid this word entirely)

### 4.3 Too-Easy Clues

**Bad:** "Not hot." (COLD)
**Fixed:** "The shock your body feels jumping into an unheated lake." (COLD)

**Bad:** "The color of grass." (GREEN)
**Fixed:** "What a traffic light shows when it is safe to go." (GREEN)

### 4.4 Answer Leakage

**Bad clue for SUNRISE:** "The sun rising over the horizon." (Contains "sun" and "rising")
**Fixed:** "The first light you see if you wake before dawn."

**Bad clue for PLANT:** "What you plant in a garden." (Contains the word)
**Fixed:** "It grows from a seed with enough water and sunlight."

### 4.5 Multiple Valid Answers

**Bad clue for SHORE:** "Edge of the water." (Could be COAST, BEACH, BRINK, BANK)
**Fixed:** "The land immediately beside the sea, where waves wash in." -- then verify that no other 5-letter synonym fits the crossing letters.

**Important:** Even if a clue seems slightly ambiguous, the crossing letters from the main word will often disambiguate. Still, aim for precision. Do not rely on intersections to save a sloppy clue.

## 5. Sensitivity Guidelines

### 5.1 Words to Avoid as Answers

- Slurs or derogatory terms (obvious)
- Words with strong negative connotations (DEATH, GRIEF -- context dependent)
- Words that are only known in one dialect (LORRY is fine in UK, less so globally)
- Medical/body terms that could make players uncomfortable
- Religious terms that could feel exclusionary

### 5.2 Clue Topics to Avoid

- Graphic violence or injury
- Explicit sexual content
- References to specific political figures or parties
- Stereotypes about any group
- Assumptions about the solver's gender, age, or background

### 5.3 When in Doubt

If you are debating whether a word or clue is appropriate, ask: "Would I be comfortable if this appeared on a billboard in a train station?" If not, cut it.

## 6. The Review Checklist

Before any clue ships, run through this:

- [ ] Does this clue have exactly one defensible answer?
- [ ] Could a non-native English speaker with intermediate fluency solve this?
- [ ] Does the clue avoid the answer word and its root forms?
- [ ] Is the clue between 10 and 200 characters?
- [ ] Does the clue end with proper punctuation (period or question mark)?
- [ ] Is the clue free of proper nouns used without universal context?
- [ ] Is the clue free of US-centric or region-locked references?
- [ ] Would this clue make sense to someone in the UK, Australia, and Canada?
- [ ] Does the clue avoid bare one-word definitions?
- [ ] Does solving this clue feel satisfying, not tedious?

## 7. Difficulty Calibration

### Easy Clues (Difficulty 1-2)
- Use common, everyday words
- Descriptive and specific
- Minimal ambiguity
- Example for BREAD: "A staple food baked from flour, water, and yeast."

### Medium Clues (Difficulty 3)
- Slightly less direct; require a mental leap
- May use figurative language
- Example for BREAD: "What a sandwich cannot exist without."

### Hard Clues (Difficulty 4)
- Require lateral thinking
- Use misdirection, metaphor, or abstraction
- Clues should NOT directly hint at the theme -- they must be oblique
- Example for BREAD: "What the desperate are said to lack."
- Example for FRESH: "What yesterday's regrets became at midnight." (Not: "New or recently made")

### Very Hard Clues (Difficulty 5)
- **Crosser clues must NOT reveal the theme.** The theme should only become apparent AFTER solving.
- Use poetic, cryptic, or philosophical language
- Clues should work on multiple levels -- the surface meaning misdirects
- Avoid any word that shares semantic overlap with the main word or theme
- The solver should need to solve 2-3 crossers before the main word becomes guessable
- Example theme "Tabula rasa" with main word FRESH:
  - BAD: "Newly picked" (too obvious)
  - BAD: "Like morning air" (hints at newness)
  - GOOD: "What yesterday's regrets became at midnight" (abstract, requires inference)
- Example crosser clue for FLARE (intersecting F in FRESH):
  - BAD: "Bright burst of light" (too direct)
  - GOOD: "Sudden burst of brilliance" (could be metaphorical)

### Theme Hint Guidelines (for Hard/Very Hard)
- The theme hint should be evocative but NOT give away the main word
- It should create an "aha" moment AFTER solving, not before
- BAD theme hint for FRESH: "Something new and clean" (gives it away)
- GOOD theme hint for FRESH: "What yesterday's regrets became at midnight" (poetic, requires solving to understand)

### Difficulty Distribution for Launch
- 20% Easy (difficulty 1-2) -- onboarding, weekends
- 40% Medium (difficulty 3) -- standard weekday puzzles
- 30% Hard (difficulty 4) -- challenging but fair
- 10% Very Hard (difficulty 5) -- "Friday hard" -- most players will need all crossers

This gives new players a gentle ramp and keeps veterans engaged.

## 8. Writing Process

1. **Start with the word.** Sit with it. What images come to mind?
2. **Write three candidate clues.** Different styles (evocative, functional, definition-plus).
3. **Eliminate.** Cross out any that break the Five Commandments.
4. **Test for ambiguity.** Ask yourself: "What other words could this clue point to?" If any share the same letter count, tighten the clue.
5. **Read it cold.** Step away, come back, read the clue as if you have never seen the answer. Does it work?
6. **Run the checklist.** Section 6 above.

## 9. Style Notes

- Write clues in sentence case, not title case.
- Use American spelling as the default, but accept both in answers (COLOR/COLOUR handled by the dictionary, not clues).
- Avoid abbreviations in clues unless universally understood (e.g., "TV" is fine, "POTUS" is not).
- Do not start clues with articles (a, an, the) unless grammatically necessary. Prefer active constructions.
- Clues may be phrased as questions, but use this sparingly.
